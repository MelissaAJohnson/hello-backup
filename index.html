                    <p>I started taking Skillcrush classes after getting recommendations from my cat. With out her constant encouragement I would have never made it to be a purrfesional Web Developer. One day I will make the Internet a safe place for all cats, where no cat will fear being meme-ified and exploited for their cuteness. </p>
